# SudokuSolver

## Description
A simple python program that uses backtracking to find the answer to a sudoku board while following sudoku rules. The reason for recursion and backtracking is that it helps make the program run faster rather than a more traditional method of checking every possible combination of numbers. 

### Challenges Faced
I faced some challenges specifically in the function for validating the number that was placed. I had difficulty visiuallizing how the code would work and overcame this by drawing out the code with pen and paper. This helped me follow a specific case of the code and thus was able to figure out how the code was working.

### Future Implementations
- I would like to continue this project and develop a GUI user interface for the sudoku board. 
- I would like to implement recursion/backtracking into more projects that require repetitive tasks and data.

#### Credits
For this project I followed a tutorial *Tech with Tim* and that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqUwSA0xI-s).
